### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**venky2908/venky2908** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal coding projects to sharpen my skills and expand my portfolio.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning applications alongside refreshing my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to machine learning or web development.

ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with understanding advanced machine learning concepts and optimizing algorithms for efficient performance.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite coding languages, my experience with different frameworks, or my thoughts on the latest tech trends!
